/// It is an [`Arc`] wrapper around [`GroupcacheInner`] which implements the API,
/// so that applications don't have to wrap groupcache inside [`Arc`] themselves
/// in concurrent context which is the target audience.
///
/// In order for groupcache peers to discover themselves application author needs to hook in some service discovery:
/// - static IP addresses of hosts running groupcache
/// - [consul](https://www.consul.io/)
/// - [kubernetes API server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/)
/// - ..
///
/// Integration of [`crate::ServiceDiscovery`] with groupcache is done via:
/// - [`Groupcache::set_peers`] - preferred for pull-based service discovery,
///
/// There are also:
/// - [`Groupcache::add_peer`] and [`Groupcache::remove_peer`] - preferred for push-based service discovery.
///
/// There is an example showing how to use kubernetes API server for service discovery with groupcache
